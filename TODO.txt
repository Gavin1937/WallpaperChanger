**BUG**
    A. Potential BUG: Windows may auto generate /CachedFile/ after program generated it
    B. Unsure BUG: WallpaperLists may be overwrite somehow
    
    C. [core] do not add more than 2 files to /Wallpapers/
    D. ./core_cache does not work properly

    E. [gui] may take a while to create icon in multi-screen mode

    F. [gui] replace ./TranscodedWallpaper file w/ default_wallpaper BEFORE set wallpaper w/ SystemParameterInfo()
             to avoid Windows from auto create low quality wallpapers from low quality cached ./TranscodedWallpaper
             This happens on multi-screen mode, all screen will receive wallpaper came from ./TranscodedWallpaper
