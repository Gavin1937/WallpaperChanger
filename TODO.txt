**BUG**

    J. Unsure issue: [gui] will crash after running for a long time. After running for a long time, gui
             will take less memory, but will crash when update_wallpaper. And later, it will
             continue crashing when program start
             This may due to uncleared ./core_cache file



**Identified**

    G. [gui] program mem usage may continue add-up w/ update_wallpaper()
       This only happens when rapidly calling update_wallpaper().
       Windows will temporarily cache something to program's running memory
       Those cached memory will be automatically remove later.

    H. [gui] use a lot of memory after open file selecting dialog.
       Windows will automatically cache after 1st time open a
       file selecting dialog for faster opening later.
       This happens in notepad and softwares as well.
       Or, QProcess in update_wallpaper() will last for a while after
       function finished because it's running async.
