**BUG**
    A. Potential BUG: Windows may auto generate /CachedFile/ after program generated it
    
    G. Potential issue: [gui] program mem usage may continue add-up w/ update_wallpaper()
    
    H. [gui] use a lot of memory

    J. [gui] will crash after running for a long time. After running for a long time, gui
             will take less memory, but will crash when update_wallpaper. And later, it will
             continue crashing when program start
             This may due to uncleared ./core_cache file

    K. [core][gui] WallpaperLists will be overwrite after update_wallpaper() been called multiple time
